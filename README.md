# 5v5-Pug-Bot
This bot is for War Lounge. It is only meant for War Lounge. I wrote this bot in under 48 hours, so I'm aware that there are theoretically better ways to do things. But the code is fairly solid, efficient, and bug free to my knowledge. PLEASE READ README.

 If the bot needs to be downloaded and run because mine crashed or something, download this repo. A minimum of Python 3.5 is needed.
 
 The bot key goes on the 2nd line of "private.txt". The Google Sheets API key goes on the 3rd and final line of "private.txt". I will not explain how to run a Discord bot, nor how to get those keys. You'll need your own keys. And Google is your friend.
 
 Additionally, I will not explain which libraries you need. However, pip can install all of the needed libraries. Off the top of my head, needed libraries include (but are not limited to): discord, dill, shutil
